Reginald Ponder,vocalo.org,“Dune: Part Two” is the type of film that will engross you with its beauty and complexity yet might confuse you at the same time. It is an epic tale worthy of the big-screen experience.,3.5/4,"Mar 17, 2024"
Jim Ross,TAKE ONE Magazine,"""DUNE: PART TWO improves on its predecessor in some crucial ways, but the reliance on spectacle leaves gaps in the storytelling and a frustratingly ephemeral interest in the most interesting ideas the film brings forward.""",NaN,"Mar 15, 2024"

Kristen Maldonado,Pop Culture Planet,"I found the film to be long and dragged out, while the cultural and religious aspects felt whitewashed. The film is star-studded with actors like Christopher Walken that felt more like glorified cameos that don’t add much to the story.",NaN,"Mar 14, 2024"

Rebecca Cusey,Christianity Today,"[Dune 2] owes its intellectual interest to Herbert’s books. Is faith merely another resource to be exploited in the quest for power? ...

Chance Solem-Pfeifer,Willamette Week,"It’s curious to say that a two-hour, 45-minute epic of this tonnage is holding something back, but Villeneuve is (once again) just as interested in prophesying the next film as he is in cementing the current one.",3/4,"Mar 6, 2024"
Chris Hewitt,Minneapolis Star Tribune,"As in all of these sci-fi epics, there are plenty of scenes in which computer-generated characters drive computer-generated vehicles past computer-generated backdrops but, in ""Dune,"" it feels human, slightly messy and organic.",3.5/4,"Mar 6, 2024"

Akhil Arora,The Long Take Podcast,"It feels more confident [as] he’s benefiting from the fact that he’s done the hard work. He’s set up the lore and the backstory in the first movie.
